You can sign up and then log in after verifying your account. 

You can buy products, you can sell your own, you can give reviews to the products you have bought, you can edit your profile, you can make dummy payments powered by stripe(use 4242 4242 4242 4242 as a dummy card number), you can keep track of all the orders you received and there is many more.
